# Adrians-Raytracer

This is a raytracer which I have been working on for the past few months and will likely continue to work on it at some point in the future.
The project was guided "The Ray Tracer Challenge", a book for which more info can be found at the following link:

# Some Images I made using the program

The raytracer supports multiple light sources, included those which are colored

This image was sent out to students of CS 246 before thier exam when I was working as an ISA that term. At the time this was rendered there
was no way to insert an image into a scene, but the stripe pattern has the ability to work recursively. So instead, I used a stripe of stripes
in order to create a grid upon which I could write "good luck".
